In this article, we will show you how to download and use Paragon Alignment Tool for Toshiba Advanced Format Drives. We will also explain what is 4K Advanced Format and why it matters for your HDD.
  
## What is 4K Advanced Format?
  
4K Advanced Format is a new standard for HDDs that increases the physical sector size from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes (4K). This allows for higher storage capacity, better error correction, and lower power consumption. However, 4K AF HDDs may not be compatible with older OSs like Windows XP, which expect 512-byte sectors. This can cause misalignment between the logical sectors of the OS and the physical sectors of the HDD, resulting in performance degradation and data corruption.
  
To avoid these problems, you need to align your partitions so that they start and end at the boundaries of the physical sectors. This can be done manually using disk management tools, but it can be complicated and risky. A safer and easier option is to use Paragon Alignment Tool, which can automatically detect and align your partitions in a few minutes.
